# 🔴 WHY THIS EXISTS. `__call__`'s catch-all returns `range(minCount)` -- the
# first N options in INDEX ORDER -- and prints a traceback to stderr. On Kaggle
# that traceback goes nowhere anyone reads, so **a submission can run the
# index-order fallback on EVERY decision and look completely normal from
# outside**: it still returns legal moves, still finishes games, still gets a
# rating. §8g had to detect exactly this indirectly, by arguing from a 40.7%
# index-0 rate over 4,682 selects against the 100% a real fallback would show.
#
# These counters make it a direct read. They are free on the happy path (one
# dict increment per select, against ~1 ms of decision time) and the summary is
# ONE LINE per game, never per-decision spam.

        same exclusion of bitwise-equivalent options -- two copies of one card
